Installation
------------

See INSTALL.txt for installation-instructions and TODO.txt for
what's missing.

Usage
-----

Common for all apps
+++++++++++++++++++

Append ``nano.<subapp>`` to your INSTALLED_APPS, where ``subapp``
is any of the tools listed above except ``tools``.

blog
++++

Blog entries can be tagged using ``django-taggit`` or ``django-tagging``
if either of those is in INSTALLED_APPS *and* NANO_BLOG_USE_TAGS
is set to True in settings. It will prefer ``django-taggit``. It
is also possible to convert from ``django-tagging`` to
``django-taggit`` using the management command
``migrate_tagging_to_taggit``. This will convert *all* tags, not
just those for blog entries.

chunk
+++++

Add 'nano.chunk.loader.Loader' to TEMPLATE_LOADERS.

Doesn't have any models so just hook up the views in an urls.py:

- ``signup()``
- ``password_change()``
- ``password_reset()``
